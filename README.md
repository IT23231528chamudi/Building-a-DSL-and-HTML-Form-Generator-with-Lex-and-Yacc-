# Building-a-DSL-and-HTML-Form-Generator-with-Lex-and-Yacc-
This project implements a domain-specific language (DSL) using Bison and Flex to dynamically generate  structured, styled HTML forms based on a high-level specification. The system allows users to define forms with a wide variety of input fields, including text, email, numbers, passwords, checkboxes, radio buttons, file inputs, and dropdowns, with support for layout grouping via sections and detailed validation rules.
 
The output.html file that the parser creates from the custom DSL includes client-side JavaScript validation logic, embedded CSS styling, and contemporary HTML form components. This guarantees both functional accuracy and an aesthetically pleasing design, with unique validation rules for fields such as NIC numbers, cell numbers, and password difficulty.
